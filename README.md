## Benjamin John Carson

I'm a globetrotter who's decided to take on the Makers Academy Dev bootcamp. I have a creative and intelligent brain that loves to tackle and (ideally) overcome problems. My dream first job in coding would be as a Full Stack Junior Developer where I can make meaningful contributions to an exciting project.

## Skills

#### Teamwork and Communication

I've always been a good team player; from group presentations at University to organising and leading a front of house team. I've honed my communication skills by leading various training sessions and through resolving customer complaints face to face.

#### Knowledge Acqusition

I am a very quick learner and I have a keen ability to seperate the fluff from the learning objective. Untill now my coding ability has been self taught, I started to take an interest at University when I bought a book on C++ and since then whenever I have some free time I like to learn something new be it HTML, CSS or Javascript.

## Interests

Yes it's now incredibly clich√©d but I love to travel, I've been to Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia to name a few. I do a lot of snowboarding and was a member of the race team at university. I'm pretty musical and dabble in quite a few instruments, even attempting a couple of open mic nights. I also do a lot of running, I find it a great way to relieve stress.
