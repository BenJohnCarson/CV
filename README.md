## Benjamin John Carson

I'm a globetrotter who's decided to take on the Makers Academy Dev bootcamp. I have a creative and intelligent brain that loves to tackle and (ideally) overcome problems. My dream first job in coding would be as a Full Stack Junior Developer where I can make meaningful contributions to an exciting project.

## Skills

#### Teamwork and Communication

I've always been a good team player; from group presentations at University to organising and leading a front of house team. I've honed my communication skills by leading various training sessions and through resolving customer complaints face to face.

#### Knowledge Acquisition

I am a very quick learner and I have a keen ability to separate the fluff from the learning objective. Until enrolling at Maker's academy, my coding has been completely self taught and fuelled by a genuine interest. So far I have a basic understanding of a number of web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc) that I hope to build on during my time at Maker's.
