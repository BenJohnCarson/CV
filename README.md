## Benjamin John Carson

I'm a globetrotter who's decided to take on the Makers Academy Dev bootcamp. I have a creative and intelligent brain that loves to tackle and (ideally) overcome problems. My dream first job in coding would be as a Full Stack Junior Developer where I can make meaningful contributions to an exciting project.
