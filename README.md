## Benjamin John Carson

I'm a sponge. And I absorb knowledge like a sponge absorbs water. The only difference being that, as far as I'm aware, this sponge has no limit on the amount of knowledge it can hold. This partly explains what's drawn me to coding, there's no hobby/job like it in terms of the amount of information you learn everyday. Problem solving is the other part. There's nothing more satisfying than using your newly discovered knowledge to overcome the problem that's been kicking your ass. Which leads me to what I'm looking for. I want a job that not only makes use of my current knowledge as a Full Stack Junior Developer, but drives me to learn more each day so that I can make meaningful contributions to an exciting project.

## Skills

#### Teamwork and Communication

I've always been a good team player; from group presentations at University to organising and leading a front of house team. I've honed my communication skills by leading various training sessions and through resolving customer complaints face to face. While at Maker's, I've learnt the value of frequent and effective communication in a group project. Be it having the courage to give an honest code review, or just through regular morning standups.

#### Knowledge Acquisition

I am a very quick learner and I have a keen ability to separate the fluff from the learning objective. Until enrolling at Maker's academy, my coding was completely self taught and fuelled by a genuine interest. I came in with a (very) basic understanding of a number of web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). After 12 weeks I can confidently say I can begin creating full stack web apps. I also feel like I'm armed with the tools to efficiently learn any tech that comes my way. An example of this would be our final project at Makers's. Without any previous experience my team managed to create a full game in Unity, writing C# scripts, in under two weeks.
