## Benjamin John Carson

I'm a maker. I find great joy in working on projects where I get to both create and problem solve. I also have an insatiable thirst for knowledge that drives me to keep upto date on the very cutting edge of technology. 
In Jan 2017 I started Maker's Acadamey with a genuine interest in coding and enthusiasm to learn. Within 6 months I got my first role as a Programmer Analyst, primarily doing frontend work as part of an agile team on a large business website using Ember.js.
My ambition is to move into a full stack role where I can continue to learn, create and problem solve in a team of like-minded people.

## Qualities

#### Conscientious

This I believe is one of the most important traits an employee can have. I care about my code, I care about its quality and I care about writing the best code that I can. I also care about my colleagues, the needs of the user and how I can best fulfil those needs with what I'm creating.

#### Teamwork and Communication

Coding is very much a team activity, and luckily I've always been a good team player; from group presentations at University to organising and leading a front of house team. I've honed my communication skills by leading various training sessions and through resolving customer complaints face to face. While at Maker's and subsequently during my professional career, I've learnt the value of frequent and effective communication in a group project. Be it having the courage to give an honest code review, or just through regular morning standups.

#### Knowledge Acquisition

I am a very quick learner and I have a keen ability to separate the fluff from the learning objective. Until enrolling at Maker's academy, my coding was completely self taught and fuelled by a genuine interest. I came in with a (very) basic understanding of a number of web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). After 12 weeks I was armed with the tools to begin creating full stack web apps and efficiently learn any tech that comes my way. An example of this would be our final project at Makers's. Without any previous experience my team managed to create a game in Unity, writing C# scripts, in under two weeks. Further to this, in the past year I've learnt from scratch two major web frameworks (Angular 4 and Ember.js).
