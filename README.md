## Benjamin John Carson

I'm a maker. I find great joy in working on projects where I get to both create and problem solve. I also have an insatiable thirst for knowledge that drives me to keep upto date on the very cutting edge of technology.\
I have a breadth of technical skills spanning front-end, back-end and DevOps and am able to effectively utilise these to create responsive, user-friendly and beautiful websites.\
Most importantly I'm conscientious, I care about my code, its quality, my colleagues and the needs of the user.
